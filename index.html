                                    I am a 37 year old aspiring web developer who is in the process of learning the wonders of web design in a coding boot camp at the University of Denver. My educational background is in Biomedical Science, where I concentrated on the neuroscience path and earned an M.S. degree. Although I very much enjoyed these studies, they have failed to secure a good and reliable career for me. There are far more applicants for positions in biotechnology than there are jobs available.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As it became clear to me that my career had become a sinking ship, I was ready to cast out on my own in a new direction. As it turned out, I wasn't really going to be alone. I am now surrounded by an amazing group of people, many of whom are in the same situation as me. Even better than this are the instructor and the TA's for this boot camp. I'm feeling extremely optimistic about the future of this new career path that I've chosen.
                                </p>

                                    The professionalism of the people who are delivering this boot camp is unbelievable. It hasn't even been a week and without a doubt this camp has more organized, more involved, more knowledgeable, and more professional people running the show than what I had experienced when I earned my graduate degree. Just when I thought my career life had irrecoverably smashed through life's rock bottom, I woke up this week to a new joy and drive that I haven't felt in many years. This is definitely happening, it's real, and I'm finally feeling that feeling of having made a good career choice.
